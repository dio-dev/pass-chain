# How Pass Chain Works 🔧

*A step-by-step visual guide (no technical jargon)*

---

## The Big Picture

Pass Chain uses **three magical ingredients**:

1. 🔐 **Split-Key Encryption** - Your key is split into 3 pieces
2. 👛 **Wallet Authentication** - Your wallet is your identity
3. ⛓️ **Blockchain Logging** - Every action is recorded forever

Let's see how they work together...

---

## Saving a Password

### Step 1: You Enter Your Password

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Pass Chain - Add Credential │
│                              │
│  Website: github.com         │
│  Username: alex@email.com    │
│  Password: ●●●●●●●●●●●       │
│                              │
│        [Save Password]       │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 2: Browser Encrypts Locally

Your browser generates a random encryption key and encrypts your password **right there on your device**.

```
Your Password: "MySecret123"
       ↓
Encryption Key: "X7f9K2mP..."
       ↓
Encrypted: "9sKf2jDp4mZq8..." ← Gibberish!
```

**Important:** Pass Chain servers **never** see "MySecret123" - only the gibberish!

### Step 3: The Key Is Split Into 3 Pieces

Now here's the magic. That encryption key is split using **Shamir Secret Sharing**:

```
Encryption Key: "X7f9K2mP..."
       ↓
   Split into 3
       ↓
┌───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐
│   Piece 1     │   Piece 2     │   Piece 3     │
│  "R5mK..."    │  "P2xJ..."    │  "L9wT..."    │
└───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘
```

**The magic:** You need **any 2 of these 3 pieces** to reconstruct the original key.

- Have only 1 piece? → Mathematically useless
- Have any 2 pieces? → Can reconstruct the key
- Have all 3 pieces? → Definitely can reconstruct

### Step 4: Pieces Go to Different Places

```
     Piece 1                 Piece 2                Piece 3
        ↓                       ↓                      ↓
   ┌─────────┐            ┌──────────┐          ┌──────────┐
   │  Vault  │            │Blockchain│          │  Your    │
   │         │            │          │          │  Device  │
   │  Secure │            │  Public  │          │  Local   │
   │ Storage │            │ Ledger   │          │ Storage  │
   └─────────┘            └──────────┘          └──────────┘
```

**Where pieces go:**

**Piece 1 → HashiCorp Vault**
- Enterprise secret manager
- Heavily protected
- Only accessible with your wallet signature

**Piece 2 → Blockchain**
- Stored in Hyperledger Fabric
- Private data collection
- Immutable and auditable

**Piece 3 → Your Device**
- Saved in your browser storage
- Backup option for you
- Under your complete control

### Step 5: Encrypted Password Stored

The encrypted gibberish is stored in our database:

```
Database Entry:
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "website": "github.com",
  "username": "alex@email.com",
  "encrypted_data": "9sKf2jDp4mZq8...",
  "wallet_address": "0x742d...",
  "vault_path": "secret/passchain/0x742d.../abc123",
  "blockchain_tx": "tx_456def"
}
```

**Notice:** No actual password, no encryption key - just encrypted gibberish!

### Step 6: Blockchain Records The Action

Finally, the blockchain logs:

```
Transaction #456def:
  Action: STORE_CREDENTIAL
  Wallet: 0x742d35d35...
  Credential ID: abc123
  Timestamp: 2025-10-23 10:30:45 UTC
  IP Hash: f5e3a2...
```

This log is **permanent and cannot be erased**.

```

## Retrieving a Password

### Step 1: You Request Access

```
You click on credential → "Show Password"
```

### Step 2: Wallet Signature Request

MetaMask (or your wallet) pops up:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│        MetaMask              │
│                              │
│  Signature Request           │
│                              │
│  "I want to access           │
│   credential abc123          │
│   at 2025-10-23 10:35:22"    │
│                              │
│   [Cancel]  [Sign]           │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

You click **Sign** (costs nothing, not a transaction).

### Step 3: Backend Verifies Signature

```
Your Signature: "0x4f2a..."
       ↓
Backend checks: Does this signature match wallet 0x742d...?
       ↓
   ✅ YES → Continue
   ❌ NO  → Reject
```

### Step 4: Fetch Piece 1 from Vault

```
Backend → Vault: "Give me piece 1 for 0x742d.../abc123"
       ↓
Vault checks authorization
       ↓
Vault returns: Piece 1 = "R5mK..."
```

### Step 5: Fetch Piece 2 from Blockchain

```
Backend → Blockchain: "Get piece 2 for abc123"
       ↓
Blockchain returns: Piece 2 = "P2xJ..."
```

### Step 6: Pieces Sent to Browser

```
Backend sends to your browser:
  - Piece 1: "R5mK..."
  - Piece 2: "P2xJ..."
  - Encrypted data: "9sKf2jDp4mZq8..."
```

**Note:** Backend still doesn't know your password!

### Step 7: Browser Reconstructs Key

```
Piece 1 + Piece 2
       ↓
Shamir Reconstruction
       ↓
Original Key: "X7f9K2mP..."
```

### Step 8: Browser Decrypts

```
Encrypted: "9sKf2jDp4mZq8..."
    +
Key: "X7f9K2mP..."
       ↓
   Decrypt
       ↓
Original Password: "MySecret123" ✅
```

### Step 9: You See Your Password

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Pass Chain - Credential     │
│                              │
│  Website: github.com         │
│  Username: alex@email.com    │
│  Password: MySecret123       │
│                              │
│        [Copy] [Hide]         │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 10: Access Is Logged

```
Blockchain Transaction #789ghi:
  Action: ACCESS_CREDENTIAL
  Wallet: 0x742d35d35...
  Credential ID: abc123
  Timestamp: 2025-10-23 10:35:30 UTC
  IP Hash: f5e3a2...
```

## Key Rotation

### Why Rotate Keys?

- Security best practice
- After a suspected breach
- Regular maintenance
- When you want to

### How It Works

```
1. You click "Rotate Key"
        ↓
2. Sign with wallet
        ↓
3. Backend:
   - Fetches old pieces
   - Reconstructs old key
   - Decrypts password
   - Generates NEW key
   - Splits NEW key into 3 pieces
   - Stores new pieces
   - Encrypts password with new key
        ↓
4. Old pieces become useless
        ↓
5. Blockchain logs rotation
```

**Result:** Even if someone had old pieces, they're now worthless!

---

## What Makes This Secure?

### The Math

**Shamir Secret Sharing** is based on polynomial mathematics:

- Imagine a line (needs 2 points to draw)
- Each piece is a point
- With 1 point, infinite possible lines exist
- With 2 points, you can draw THE line
- With 3 points, you have redundancy

**In code:**
```
Need 2 of 3 pieces = (2, 3) threshold
Need 3 of 5 pieces = (3, 5) threshold
Pass Chain uses (2, 3)
```

### The Reality

**Attacker scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Hack our database**
→ Gets encrypted passwords (gibberish)
→ Needs encryption keys
→ We don't have them!

**Scenario B: Hack Vault**
→ Gets Piece 1
→ Needs Piece 2 or 3
→ Not in Vault!

**Scenario C: Read blockchain**
→ Gets Piece 2
→ Needs Piece 1 or 3
→ Not on blockchain!

**Scenario D: Steal your device**
→ Gets Piece 3
→ Needs Piece 1 or 2
→ Needs your wallet to access them!

**Scenario E: Hack Vault AND read blockchain**
→ Gets Piece 1 + Piece 2
→ **Could reconstruct key!**
→ But this requires compromising 2 independent systems simultaneously
→ And you get alerted and can rotate

## Recovery Scenarios

### Lost Device?

```
1. Get new device
   ↓
2. Restore wallet (12-word seed phrase)
   ↓
3. Login to Pass Chain
   ↓
4. All passwords available ✅
```

**Why it works:** Pieces 1 & 2 are still in Vault/Blockchain

### Lost Wallet?

```
1. Restore wallet from seed phrase
   ↓
2. Everything works again ✅
```

**Why it works:** Your wallet is just math, seed phrase recreates it

### Forgot Seed Phrase? (Worst Case)

```
1. Piece 3 backed up on device?
   ↓
2. Contact support with:
   - Piece 3
   - Proof of identity
   - Request Piece 1 from Vault
   ↓
3. Piece 3 + Piece 1 = Can decrypt ✅
   ↓
4. Create new wallet
   ↓
5. Rotate all keys to new wallet
```

**Why it works:** Remember, any 2 of 3 pieces work!

### Our Systems Hacked?

```
1. We detect breach
   ↓
2. Send alert to all users
   ↓
3. Users rotate keys (2 minutes)
   ↓
4. Old pieces become useless ✅
   ↓
5. Passwords remain secure
```

## The User Experience

### What You Do:
1. Connect wallet (once)
2. Enter password
3. Sign request
4. Done!

### What You See:
- Simple, clean interface
- Password forms (like any manager)
- Sign buttons (MetaMask popup)
- Your credentials list

### What You DON'T See:
- Key splitting (automatic)
- Blockchain transactions (background)
- Vault operations (handled for you)
- Encryption algorithms (just works)

**It's simple to use, complex underneath!**
