# Pass Chain - Project Specification

## Overview

Pass Chain is a decentralized, secure password management system that leverages blockchain technology and vault-based encryption to provide unparalleled security for credential storage.

## Core Concept

Users connect their crypto wallet to store passwords and credentials in a highly secure manner. The security model uses a split-key approach where credentials are sharded across:

1. **HashiCorp Vault** - Stores half of the encryption key
2. **Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain** - Stores the other half with immutable audit logs

This dual-layer approach ensures that neither component alone can reveal the stored credentials, making it virtually impossible to break.

## Key Features

### 1. Wallet-Based Authentication

* Users authenticate using their crypto wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
* Wallet address serves as the unique identifier
* No traditional username/password required

### 2. Secure Credential Storage

* Split-key encryption architecture
* Half of encrypted data stored in Vault
* Half stored on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain
* Only wallet owner can decrypt and retrieve credentials

### 3. Pay-Per-Use Model

* **One-time storage fee**: Pay once to store a credential
* **Usage fee**: Pay each time you retrieve/reveal a password
* Payments handled via smart contracts
* Transparent pricing on blockchain

### 4. Complete Audit Trail

* Every password read operation recorded on blockchain
* Immutable log of:
  * Timestamp of access
  * Source IP/location (encrypted)
  * User wallet address
  * Credential identifier
* Users can review their access history

### 5. Advanced Security Features

* End-to-end encryption
* Zero-knowledge architecture (backend never sees plaintext)
* Rate limiting and anomaly detection
* Multi-signature support for enterprise accounts
* Auto-expire credentials option

## Architecture Components

### Frontend Application

* Modern web application (React/Next.js)
* Web3 wallet integration
* Intuitive UI for credential management
* Real-time usage analytics dashboard

### Backend Service (Go)

* RESTful API server
* Handles coordination between Vault and blockchain
* Payment processing and validation
* Access control and rate limiting
* Webhook notifications

### Blockchain Layer (Hyperledger Fabric)

* Private blockchain network
* Smart contracts for payment processing
* Immutable audit logs
* Usage tracking and billing

### Infrastructure

* HashiCorp Vault for secret management
* Terraform for infrastructure as code
* Kubernetes for container orchestration
* Secure networking and access controls

## Security Model

### Data Flow - Store Credential

1. User encrypts credential client-side with wallet signature
2. Backend receives encrypted data
3. Data is split into two shards using Shamir's Secret Sharing
4. Shard A → Stored in Vault with metadata
5. Shard B → Stored on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain
6. Transaction hash returned to user
7. Payment processed via smart contract

### Data Flow - Retrieve Credential

1. User requests credential with wallet signature
2. Backend verifies payment and access rights
3. Retrieves Shard A from Vault
4. Retrieves Shard B from blockchain
5. Reconstructs encrypted data
6. Returns to client for decryption
7. Usage logged on blockchain

## Payment Structure

### Storage Fees

* Per credential: 0.001 ETH (or equivalent)
* Includes indefinite storage
* One-time payment

### Usage Fees

* Per retrieval: 0.0001 ETH (or equivalent)
* Microtransaction via Layer 2 or state channels
* Paid from user's wallet

### Enterprise Pricing

* Volume discounts available
* Monthly/annual plans
* Custom SLAs

## Target Users

### Individual Users

* Crypto enthusiasts seeking secure password management
* Privacy-conscious individuals
* Users managing multiple high-value accounts

### Enterprise Users

* Companies requiring auditable credential access
* Teams needing secure secret sharing
* Organizations with compliance requirements

## Success Metrics

* Number of stored credentials
* Active wallet addresses
* Transaction volume
* Retrieval success rate
* Average response time < 500ms
* 99.9% uptime SLA

## Compliance & Legal

* GDPR compliant
* SOC 2 Type II certification target
* Data residency options
* Right to deletion (with blockchain considerations)

## Future Enhancements

* Mobile applications (iOS/Android)
* Browser extensions
* Emergency access/recovery mechanisms
* Credential sharing with time limits
* Integration with password generators
* Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
* Biometric authentication layer
